    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Code Challenge, you will be using the **\"primary\" data set**, as we've called it. The primary data set is   \n",
    "\n",
    "    * labeled data set of 350,000 simulated signals\n",
    "    * 7 different labels, or \"signal classifications\"\n",
    "    * total of about 128 GB of data\n",
    "    \n",
    "This data set should be used to train your models. \n",
    "\n",
    "**You do not need to use all the data to train your models** if you do not want to or need to consume the entire set. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are also a **`small` and a `medium` sized subset** of these primary data files. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simple Data Format\n",
    "\n",
    "Each data file has a simple format: \n",
    "\n",
    "    * file name = <UUID>.dat\n",
    "    * a JSON header in the first line that contains:\n",
    "        * UUID\n",
    "        * signal_classification (label)\n",
    "    * followed by stream complex-valued time-series data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `ibmseti` Python package is available to assist in reading this data and performing some basic operations for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Warmup Data Set.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a second, simple and clean data set that you may use for warmup, which we call the **\"basic\" data set**. This basic set should be used as a sanity check and for very early-stage prototyping. We recommend that everybody starts with this. \n",
    "\n",
    "    * Only 4 different signal classifications\n",
    "    * 1000 simulation files for each class: 4000 files total\n",

    "    * ~1 GB in total. \n",
    "       \n",
    "### Basic Set versus Primary Set\n",
    "\n",
    "> The difference between the `basic` and `primary` data sets is that the signals simulated in the `basic` set have, on average, much higher signal to noise ratio (they are larger amplitude signals). They also have other characteristics that will make the different signal classes very distinguishable. **You should be able to get very high signal classification accuracy with the basic data set.**  The primary data set has smaller amplitude signals and can look more similar to each other, making classification accuracy more difficult with this data set. There are also only 4 classes in the basic data set and 7 classes in the primary set. \n",
