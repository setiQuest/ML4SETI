    "TensorFlow defines computations as Graphs, and these are made with operations (also know as “ops”). So, when we work with TensorFlow, it is the same as defining a series of operations in a Graph.\n",

The resultant tensors of each operation cross the next one until the end where it's possible to get the wanted result."
